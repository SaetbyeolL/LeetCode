# Given a string 's', find the length of the longest substring without repaeting characters.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        
        
        
        
        





# Test
s1 = "abcabcbb"
print(lengthOfLongestSubstring(s1))
s2 = "bbbbb"
print(lengthOfLongestSubstring(s2))
s3 = "pwwkew"
print(lengthOfLongestSubstring(s3))
