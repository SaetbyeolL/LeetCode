# Sqrt(x)
# Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. 
# The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
# You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

# class Solution:
#     def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        
        
        
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x == 0 or x == 1:
            return x
        
        






# Test
# sol = Solution()
# x1 = 4
# print(sol.mySqrt(x1));

# sol = Solution()
# x2 = 8
# print(sol.mySqrt(x2));
