# Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. 
# If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
# Assume the environment does not allow you to sotre 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
